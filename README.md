> An implementation of the most well-known sorting algorithms for the purpose of practice and personal improvement in Python programming.

## Implemented Algorithms

- [X] Bubble Sort
- [X] Insertion Sort
- [X] Selection Sort
- [X] Merge Sort
- [X] Quick Sort

## ðŸ’» Requirements

The following setup was used to make the source code on this repository:

* Windows 10
* Python 3.8.10
* tkinter

## â˜• Get Started

Using your Python installation, change directory to the project folder and run the main file:

```
python main.py
```

Then, you will be faced with two options. The first one will sort a sample of the size of your choice, whereas the second one will open the visualizer made with tkinter.

## :wrench: Known Issues

* The visualizer freezes sometimes when performing some algorithms with specific sample amounts and at specific speeds. 
This is probably due of the update function used to make the tkinter canva update constantly. I have yet to find a proper
solution.
